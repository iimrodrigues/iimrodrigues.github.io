    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Hi, my name is Ines Machinho Rodrigues and I am currently a student at Simon Fraser University (SFU) majoring in Software Systems. 
            I moved to Surrey in Fall 2020 to begin my degree at SFU, but after 2 years of being homesick, I decided to take a break to gain my footing before continuing to pursue my degree. 
            I became very interested in Concept Art and studied at Vancouver Animation School (VANAS) during 2023. In Fall 2024, I decided that I was ready for university again and was looking forward to continuing my learning. 

            During my spare time, I like to draw, crochet and play video games. 
            Despite not pursuing a career in Concept Art, I still strive to improve my art skills. 
            I am also passionate about video games, as I love seeing the storytelling and designs of the characters, environment, and gameplay. 
            Finally, I picked up crochet in 2020 and have been crocheting ever since! I started an Etsy page as well as an Instagram page to share my crochet projects with others.
